## Cubing confidence intervals

Have you ever wondered "When can I call myself sub-x?"

This code computes the confidence intervals for your cstimer sessions.

Confidence intervals come from statistics, and a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance for a solve to fall within that interval.

Now you don't have to use inaccurate measures like "If you get a sub-10 average of 100, then you are sub-10"

## How to use

You have to have a little bit of coding knowledge to use this.

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to cstimer, and export your data to a file
3. Put the file in the same folder as this notebook
4. Name the file cstimer.json
5. Run the code below
